Basics of MongoDB

================= Connectivity =====================
How to connect to MongoDB (local) server (using shell)?
    1) execute 'mongod' command
    2) In another shell, execute 'mongo' command
====================================================

=================== Database =======================
How to see pre-existing DBs?
    execute 'show dbs'
    *mind the 's' in lower-case 'd' in dbs.

How to check which DB is currently in use?
    execute 'db'

How to create a DB?
    execute 'use <nameOfTheDB>'
    *If any DB with name 'nameOfTheDB' doesn't exits, it will be created with the same name.
    *If the DB is empty, it doesn't get saved.
    *If any DB with name 'nameOfTheDB' exists, it will be selected as current DB.

How to delete existing DB?
    execute 'db.dropDatabase()'
    *only the current DB which is selected gets deleted (Switch to desired DB before executing this).

How to rename a DB?
    You can't! A hack is that you create a new DB as a copy of the old DB and then delete the old DB.

How to create backup (or dump) of a DB?
    execute 'mongodump --host <hostName> --port <portNumber>'                   (Backup of all DBs on a host).
    execute 'mongodump --dbpath <locationOfTheDB>' --out <locationForBackup>    (Backup all DBs on a specified location).
    execute 'mongodump --db <nameOfTheDB> --collection <nameOfTheCollection>'   (Backup a specified Collection belonging t0 a specified DB)
    *the --out flag could be used with any of the above command

How to restore a (backup) or a dump file?
    execute 'mongorestore -d <nameOfTheDB> -c <nameOfTheCollection>'            (not completely tested due to lack of knowledge)

(If mongodump or mongorestore can't be defined or found, install mongodb-tools package.)
====================================================

================= Collections ======================
How to see all the Collections in a DB?
    execute 'show collections'
    *mind the 's' in lower-case 'c' in collections.

How to create a Collection in a DB?

How to delete a Collection from a DB?
    execute 'db.<nameOfTheCollection>.drop()

How to rename a Collection?
    execute 'db.<nameOfTheCollection>.renameCollection("newName")
====================================================

================== Records/Queries =================
How to insert a single data/record in a collection?
    In 2 ways, using file/list or manually.
    
    (using file)
    db.<nameOfTheCollection>.insertOne(<fileName>)
    *the <fileName> must contain a list of key-value pairs in form of '"key":"value"'.
    *scope of a single record is defined by curly-braces '{}'.

    (manually)
    db.<nameOfTheCollection>.insertOne({"key1" : value1", "key2" : value2})

How to insert multiple records in a Collection?
    In 3 ways, using insert(), insertMany() or manually(not preferred)
    db.<nameOfTheCollection>.insert([<fileName1>, <fileName2>, <fileName3>]) or
    db.<nameOfTheCollection>.insertMany([<fileName>, <fileName2>, <fileName3>])
